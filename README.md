### an introduction
i cant spend more than 10 mins on a project without it tURNING TO SHIT HOLY FUCKIN SHIT. if theres one thing willyshell has taught me its to never hardcode things ;-; especially with PRINTING TEXT JESUS.

half the time i was fighting with ma own logic making the terminal. well at least its kinda easy to make programs/apps for it uwu

ig u can use it as like ,,, a screen ?? an easy console print kinda thing ?? idk go nuts.

### how to go to a program
```
> list
[list of programs]
> go [program]

hit esc to go back to terminal at any time.
```

### list of commands
```
> help
> echo [text]
> list (the list of programs)
> cmd (the list of commands)
> cake
> color [hex color]
